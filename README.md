# blastGTDB

These scripts are to download GTDB and make it usable for blast.

Then, blastn the ASVs to identify the genomes by comparing the sequences against the GTDB.

After blasting, one can fetch the full genomes from NCBI by the accession number. Follow [this repo](https://github.com/xl0418/GetGenome)
